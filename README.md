# Flappy Plane
A Flappy Bird adaptation with a plane instead of a bird. This is my first ever game.


Your plane needs periodic refueling to stay in air.

Land on refueling stations displayed on the ground and complete the minigame to fill up your tank!

You will get attacked by fireballs, which take away your health points. Combat them with missiles by pressing **`V`**!

You can pause gravity by holding **`C`** on your keyboard. This makes it easier to get through the pipes. **But keep in mind that pausing gravity consumes a lot more fuel!**

Don't forget to collect coins, with which you can unlock new planes or revive yourself and get a second chance if you die!


## Hotkeys
**`SPACE`** -- jump

**`V`** -- shoot missiles

**`X`** -- pause/resume game

**`C`** -- pause gravity

**`T`** -- open cheat code input


## Cheat Codes
**`DIE`** -- instantly kills the player

**`TSISTOOSLOW`** -- speeds the game up (incremental)

**`IHAVEASEVERESKILLISSUE`** -- turns off death by collision with pipes

**`FILLMEUP`** -- adds 2000 fuel to the player

**`CLEARSTATS`** -- clears saved high score and coins

# Config Files
This game uses .cfg files with lots of adjustable game variables.

You can export these files right from the in-game Tunables menu and share your custom configurations with your friends! How convenient!

## Assets
I used free assets from the internet with non-restrictive licenses.

You can find their respective licenses/attributions in the `assets/` folder or displayed in the Credits menu in-game.

## AI Disclaimer
AI (LLMs) was used during the creation of this project.

I used GitHub Copilot Chat to help me with various repetetive tasks, or to help me learn GDscript and Godot, since this is my first project in it.

I sometimes let it write me code snippets, which I never blindly copy directly as outputted by the model, but rather I make sure I understand it and often adapt it to better suit my needs. 

AI code completion was not used, since it isn't available in the Godot editor.
