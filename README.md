# Flappy Plane
A Flappy Bird adaptation with a plane instead of a bird. This is my first ever game.


Your plane needs periodic refueling to stay in air.

Land on refueling stations on the ground *(currently displayed as a black rectangle)* and complete the minigame to fill up your tank!


You can pause gravity by holding **`C`** on your keyboard. This makes it easier to get through the pipes.

**But keep in mind that pausing gravity consumes a lot of fuel!**


## Hotkeys
**`SPACE`** -- jump

**`X`** -- pause/resume game

**`C`** -- pause gravity

**`T`** -- open cheat code input


## Cheat Codes
**`DIE`** -- instantly kills the player

**`TSISTOOSLOW`** -- speeds the game up (incremental)

**`IHAVEASEVERESKILLISSUE`** -- turns off death by collision with pipes

**`FILLMEUP`** -- adds 2000 fuel to the player

**`CLEARSTATS`** -- clears saved high score and coins


## Assets
I used free assets from the internet with non-restrictive licenses.


You can find their respective licenses in the `assets/` folder or displayed in the Credits menu in-game.

## AI Disclaimer
AI (LLMs) was used during the creation of this project.

I used GitHub Copilot Chat to help me with various repetetive tasks, or to help me learn GDscript and Godot, since this is my first project in it.

I sometimes let it write me code snippets, which I never blindly copy directly as outputted by the model, but rather I make sure I understand it and often adapt it to better suit my needs. 

AI code completion was not used, since it isn't available in the Godot editor.
